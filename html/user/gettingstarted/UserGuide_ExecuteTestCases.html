<title>Execute TestCases</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Execute TestCases</h1>
	<p>
	In a few steps, you will be able to create a TestCampaign out of TestCases in your TestSpecification and evaluate them.
	In order to get a quick overview, you can also use the Cheat Sheet.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Setup Test Environment</h2>
	<p>
	 Make sure your card reader is connected to you computer.<br></br>
	 If you have to connect it first and GlobalTester 3 is running,
	 GlobalTester 3 will not be able to recognize and embed it into its functionality, so please start GlobalTester 3 again.<br></br>
	 Place your card on the reader.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Import your TestSpecification</h2>
	<p>
	If not already done, import one or more
	<a href="../../../../org.globaltester.testspecification.doc/html/user/gettingstarted/UserGuide_ImportOfATestSpec.html">TestSpecification(s)</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Create and execute TestCampaign</h2>
	<p>
	There are two possibilities to create a <a href="../concepts/TestCampaign.html">TestCampaign</a>:
	<ol>
	<li>Create a TestCampaign and execute it, or</li>
	<li>Select TestCases to execute (this will create a TestCampaign as well).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	<h3>Create a TestCampaign and execute it</h3>
	<p>
	  In the TestSpecification(s) you have chosen, select the TestCases you want to execute.
	  Right-click your mouse, and choose <b>&quot;Create TestCampaign&quot;</b>.
	  A TestCampaign will be created and opened in the TestCampaign Editor.
	  It consists of your selected TestCases, the execution states, the log files documenting the test results,
	  and the subset of the TestSpecification(s) you have chosen (i.e. the TestCases you have chosen).<br></br>
	  You can (re-) execute your TestCampaign by clicking the <b>&quot;Execute&quot;</b> button.	
	</p>
	<h3>Select TestCases to execute</h3>
	<p>
	 In the TestSpecification(s) you have chosen, select the TestCases you want to execute.
	 Right-click your mouse, and this time choose <b>&quot;RunTest&quot;</b>.<br></br>
     A TestCampaign will be created and executed directly.
     Of course you can execute it again by clicking the <b>&quot;Execute&quot;</b> button.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Evaluate Log File(s)</h2>
	<p>
	Each execution of a TestCampaign will have an own <a href="../concepts/LogFiles.html">log file</a>.
	There, the logging of all executed TestCases will be reported.
	You can see the communication between the card and the reader.<br></br>
	If you have selected &quot;Add separate logfile for each testcase&quot; in the Logging-Preferences,
	each executed TestCase will have its own log file.<br></br>
	You can easily access the log files:
	<ul>
	<li>In the TestCampaign editor, you can see a tree view displaying the last execution of the TestCampaign structured in its TestCase and Test Steps.
    Right-click with your mouse on the root of the tree view which corresponds to the last execution of the TestCampaign,
    and choose <b>&quot;Show log file&quot;</b>.<br></br>
    The log file of the last execution of the TestCampaign will open.</li>
	<li>If you have selected the option for single log files, you can open it by right-clicking on a TestCase and choosing &quot;Show log file&quot;.</li>
	<li>If you right-click on an ActionStep (i.e. PreCondition, TestStep, or PostCondition),
	the log file (for the last execution of the TestCampaign or of the single TestCase if selected)
	will open with the line highlighted in which the log of the ActionStep begins. </li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	If you have a <b>&quot;Failure&quot;</b> reported in the TestCampaign editor, 
	you can find the error in the TestCase execution by looking for &quot;@FailureID1&quot;, &quot;@FailureID2&quot;, etc.
    The lines in the  log file where they appear will have a red marker.
    When you click on it, the line where the failure is reported will be highlighted in the opening log file.<br></br>
    Usually &quot;@FailureID1&quot; is the essential source of error.
    For example, if you have no card placed on you reader, it will be the missing &quot;card&quot; reference.
    </p>
    <p>
    The APDU commands are syntax highlighted, and if you hover over it with your mouse, the APDU command is declared in its parts.
	You see the information
	<ul>
	<li>Which ISO Case command is used</li>
	<li>CLA byte (indicates plain APDU or Secure Messaging)</li>
	<li>INS (declares which command the APDU is)</li>
	<li>P1 and P2 (possible protocols, etc.)</li>
	<li>LC byte(s)</li>
	<li>LE byte(s)</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	The response APDUs are also highlighted and thus can be easily spotted.
	Status words are extracted and interpreted.<br></br>
	They can be checked, and be another source for a &quot;Failure&quot; report.
    </p>´
    
    <h2>Generate Report</h2>
    <p>
    You can generate a report of your execution by clicking the <b>&quot;Generate Report&quot;</b> button.
    A folder browser will open where you can choose the folder you want the report to be saved in.<br></br>
    The test report will comprise
    <ul>
    <li><b>Test summary</b>: specifies the tilte and the version of the TestSpecification.</li>
    <li><b>Test setup</b></li>
    <li><b>Test statistics</b>: lists the date of the execution, execution time, and the numbers of passed and failed tests.</li>
    <li><b>Overview of executed test cases</b>: 
    lists all TestCase IDs, their Description, the time of the execution, and the result (reported as &quot;Passed&quot;, &quot;Failure&quot;, or &quot;Unknown&quot;)</li>
    <li><b>Test case results</b></li>
    </ul>
