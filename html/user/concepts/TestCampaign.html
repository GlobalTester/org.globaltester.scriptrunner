	<h1>TestCampaign</h1>
	<p>
	A <b>TestCampaign</b> is a dynamic collection of TestCases and their Executions.
	</p>
	<p>
	A TestCampaign is displayed in the TestCampaign browser. There you can see the latest results (and browse others),
	open TestCases and log files, and execute them again. You can also generate a report of your last execution.
	</p>
	<p>
	The TestCases are taken from their TestSpecification,
	and will be stored in the folder &quot;TestSpecification&quot;.
	</p>
	<p>
	Each TestCase and its steps (PreCondition, TestStep(s), and PostCondition) are executed in a TestCampaign.
	Information of each execution is saved in a TestCaseExecution (respectively a PreConditionExecution, TestStepExecution, andPostConditionExecution).
	It covers the start time of the execution, the duration, the result, the name of the log file and the line the logging starts, and the URL
	of the TestCase resource itself.This information will be stored in an XML file in the folder <b>ExecutionState</b>. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The log files of the TestCampaign executions (and of the single log files for each TestCase, if that option was set in the Preferences) will be stored
	in the folder TestResults.
