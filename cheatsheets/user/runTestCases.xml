   <intro>
   <description>
     In a few steps, this cheat sheet will guide you through the run and evaluation of TestCases.
     You will need a card reader and an ePassport. You can also use an nPA, but then switch any
     statements regarding nPA with ePassport and vice-versa.

         title="Prepare first Test Setup">
      <description>
         Make sure your card reader is connected to you computer. First, do not put your ePassport on it.
         If your card reader just had to be connected, start GlobalTester 3 again.

         title="Import your TestSpecification">
      <description>
         If not already done, import the &quot;GlobalTester Sample TestSpecification&quot;.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item
         title="Create and run TestCampaign">
      <description>
        In your &quot;GlobalTester Sample TestSpecification&quot;, select the TestCases &quot;SelectApplication_nPA.xml&quot;
        and &quot;SelectApplication_ePassport.xml&quot;.
        Right-click your mouse, and choose <b>&quot;RunTest&quot;</b>.
        A TestCampaign will be created and run directly.
        Both TestCases will have a &quot;FAILURE&quot; in their &quot;Status&quot;-column in the TestCampaign editor.

         title="Try to find the Error in your Log File">
      <description>
        Right-click with your mouse on the TestCampaign in the TestCampaign editor, and choose &quot;Show log file&quot;.
        The log file will open. Have a close look at it.
        You can find your error in the TestCase execution by looking for &quot;@FailureID1&quot;, &quot;@FailureID2&quot;, etc.
        Usually &quot;@FailureID1&quot; is the essential source of error; here it is the missing &quot;card&quot; reference
        (because you have no card placed on your reader).

   <item
         title="Run TestCampaign with different Setup">
      <description>
      	Now put your ePassport on the card reader.
        You can (re-) run your TestCampaign by clicking the <b>&quot;Execute&quot;</b> button.
        This time the &quot;SelectApplication_nPA&quot; execution will be a failure as well,
        but the &quot;SelectApplication_ePassport&quot; execution will be declared as &quot;PASSED&quot;.

   <item
         title="Evaluate Log File again...">
      <description>
        Open the log file. For the &quot;SelectApplication_ePassport&quot; log, you can see the communication between the card and the reader.
        The command APDU is syntax highlighted by the GlobalTester APDU hover function.
        When you hover over it, you can see information about the command APDU.
        The response APDU is shown as well, and its status word is extracted.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item
         title="... and again.">
      <description>
        This time there is a &quot;card&quot; reference, so there is also a command APDU in the &quot;SelectApplication_nPA&quot; execution.
        The response APDU is only the status word &quot;6a82&quot;, because there is no nPA related eID application on your card.

         title="Generate Report">
      <description>
        You can generate a report of your run by clicking the <b>&quot;Generate Report&quot;</b> button.
        A folder browser will open where you can choose the folder you want the report to be saved in.
